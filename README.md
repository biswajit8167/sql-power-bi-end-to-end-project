🚜 Excited to share my latest project on Crop Production Analysis using SQL! 🌾

In this project, I analyzed agricultural data from various Indian states over multiple years to gain insights into crop production efficiency and trends. 📊 Here’s what I worked on:

1️⃣ Crop Yield Efficiency: Identified which crops are the most efficient based on yield (production per unit area).

2️⃣ Year-over-Year Growth: Calculated the percentage growth in crop production for each state and crop over time.

3️⃣ Top Performing States: Ranked states based on average crop yield to highlight the most productive regions.

4️⃣ Production Variance: Measured the stability of crop production across different crops and states using variance analysis.

5️⃣ Cultivated Area Insights: Identified states with the largest increase in cultivated area for specific crops between years.

💡 Key Insights:

Certain states show remarkable crop yield efficiency, while others have significant growth potential.
Understanding variance in production helps improve crop stability and long-term planning.
🔧 Tools used:

SQL for data querying and analysis
Data visualization to showcase findings (Power BI)
